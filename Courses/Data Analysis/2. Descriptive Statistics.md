Stats helps to get a better comprehension of a complex phenomena in order to be able to manage it

* # Statistics Consists of:
	#Statistics_Consists_of
	
	- Collect data.  
	- Present and summarize this data.  
	- Draw conclusions about the population studied and assist in decision-making.  
	- In the presence of time-dependent data, we try to make predictions.

* # Concepts
     
	* ## Population
		#Population
		
		Denoted $\Omega$
		==the whole== on which our statistical study relates.
     
	* ## Individual Statistical Unit
		#Individual_Statistical_Unit
		
		* Denoted $\omega$
		* An element of $\Omega$
     
	* ## Character Statistical Variable
		#Character_Statistical_Variable
		
		* Let $C$ be the set of values of the character $X$ (this is what is measured or observed on individuals).
		* A character **X** is any application
			* $X : \Omega \rightarrow C$
     
	* ## Terms
		#Terms
		
		* The modalities of a statistical variable are the different values that it can take.
     
	* ## Discrete Statistical Variable
		#Discrete_Statistical_Variable
		
		* $X : \Omega \rightarrow \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$
		* If _n_ is finite (i.e., the Variable $X$ can take a finite number of values), then we call $X$ a Discrete Statistical Variable.
     
	* ## Partial Workforce Absolute Frequency
		#Partial_Workforce_Absolute_Frequency
		
		* For $x_i \in \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$
		* $n_i = \text{Card}(\{\omega_i \in \Omega : X(\omega_i) = x_i\})$
		* $n_i$ is the partial effective of $x_i$ (the number of individuals who have the same $x_i$).
	
	* ## Cumulative Workforce
		#Cumulative_Workforce 
		
		* The cumulative number $N_i$ of a value is ==how many values less then or equal to $x_i$ are there==
		* $N_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} n_j$
	
	* ## Partial Frequency 
		#Partial_Frequency
		
		* The frequency of a value is the ratio of the number of this value to the total number.
		* for every $x_i$ we define:
		* $f_i = \frac{n_i}{N}$
		* where $N = Card(\Omega)$
	
	* ## Cumulative Frequency
		#Cumulative_Frequency
		
		* Same idea as Cumulative Workforce
		* $F_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i}f_j$

* # Graphical representation of statistical series

	* ## Discrete quantitative distribution
		#Discrete_quantitative_distribution
		
		* **Bar Chart**
			#Bar_Chart
			
			* $n_i$ or $f_i$ in function of $x_i$

		* **Cumulative Diagram**
			#Cumulative_Diagram
			
			* $F_i$ in function of $x_i$

	* ## Qualitative distribution
		#Qualitative_Distribution
		
		* **Organ pipes** (bar diagram)
			#Organ_pipes
			#Bar_Diagram
			
			* $f_i$ or $n_i$ in function of $x_i$

		* ## Sector chart (circle chart)

			#Circle_Chart
			
			![[Circle_Chart_Example.png]]

* # Position parameters (central tendency characteristic)
	#Position_Parameters
	 #Central_Tendency_Characteristic
	* ## Mode
		 #Mode
		 
		* The mode of a Variable X is the value which has the greatest partial frequency (or the greatest partial frequency)
		* denoted by **_Mo_**
	* ## Median
		#Median
		
		* denoted **_Me_**
		* **_Me_** is the value $\in \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ that satisfies:
			==$F_X(Me^-) \lt 0.5 \leq F_X(Me^+)$
		* this means that the point where $X = Me$ splits the observations into 2
		* Note that the observations should be ordered
	* ## Average
		#Average
		* given that $N = Card(\Omega)$
		* the average is given by:
			$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}n_ix_i$
			$\overline{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}f_ix_i$

* # Dispersion parameters (variability)
	#Dispersion_Parameters 
	#Variability 
	
	* ## Extent
		#Extent
		#etendue
		
		* The difference between the largest value and the smallest value of the character
		* $e = x_{max} - x_{min}$
     
	* ## Variance
		#Variance
		
		 * $Var(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i(\overline{x} - x_i^2)$
	
	 * ## Standard Deviation
		 #Standard_Deviation
		 
		 * $\sigma_X = \sqrt{Var(X)}$
